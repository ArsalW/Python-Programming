    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Most object-oriented languages are high-level languages. The focus of OOP languages is not on structure, but on modeling data. Programmers code using “blueprints” of data models called classes. Examples of OOP languages include C++, Visual Basic.NET and Java.\n",

    "**Class**\n",
    "A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class. In Python we create instances in the following manner\n",

    "\n",
    "**Attribute**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of Attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class. It is an instance attribute defined inside the constructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object. It is shared between all the objects of this class and it is defined outside the constructor function, __init__(self,...), of the class. It is a class attribute defined outside the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below ExampleClass is a basic Python class with two attributes: class_attr and instance_attr. \n",

    "**Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change — this eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behaviour**\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in Python are generally classified according to their behaviors and the features that they implement. For example, all of the sequence types such as strings, lists, and tuples are grouped together merely because they all happen to support a common set of sequence operations such as s[n], len(s), etc. All basic interpreter operations are implemented through special object methods. The names of special methods are always preceded and followed by double underscores (__). These methods are automatically triggered by the interpreter as a program executes. The behavior of each data type depends entirely on the set of special methods that it implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined classes can define new objects that behave like the built-in types simply by supplying an appropriate subset of the special methods described in this section. In addition, built-in types such as lists and dictionaries can be specialized (via inheritance) by redefining some of the special methods.\n"
